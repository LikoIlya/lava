   * - sandbox:   the local sandboxed network used to run unit tests and to test contract deploying
   * - testnet:   the remote test network you can use to run (unit or) e2e tests and to deploy contract and test integration with your app
   * - mainnet:   the public node of the real Tezos network, used only to deploy the finished contract
